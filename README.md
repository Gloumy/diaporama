## A pretty simple Flutter app to browse Reddit with swiping gestures  
You select your content source (list of subreddits) and you just have to swipe right/left to navigate between threads. Ain't it easy ?

### Features (as of 2020-03-26)

 - [x] Retrieve content from Front Page/Popular
 - [x] Anonymous/Authenticated mode
 - [x] Manage your content sources (add/remove)
	 - [x] Search subreddits with autocomplete
 - [x] PageView display of threads
 - [x] Comments display
 - [x] Dark Theme (actually that's the only theme)
 - [x] Implemented design (at least to me it doesn't look that ugly)

### Next steps

 - [ ] Implement something for the "redditSecret"
 - [ ] Improve the handling of different submissions types
 - [ ] Improve comments display
 - [ ] Implement comment reply
 - [ ] Implement upvote/downvote
 - [ ] Implement settings page
 - [ ] Improve miscellaneous things and implement a lot of other things that are still missing to look like a real Reddit client !

Thanks to TheNightmanCodeth for his DitRA work, i've taken inspiration and copied some code for the comments part. I'll rework that later, but it allowed me to not be stuck and continue the development.
