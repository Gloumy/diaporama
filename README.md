# Diaporama (for Reddit)

## A pretty simple Flutter app to browse Reddit with swiping gestures

### Intended Features
* Create subreddits list
* Swipe through displayed posts (PageView)
* Light and Dark themes
* Autoplay
* Maybe more if i think about something else ..

### Status (2020-03-05)
* Reddit OAuth
* Fetch popular posts
* Display them as a PageView with comments

#### Next Steps
* Implement a base settings page (at least to handle login/logout for now)
* Review the PostTypes to handle possibly more cases
* Implement a real design

### Contribute
Well, don't hesitate to share feedback and/or ideas !

### Running the app
No configuration needed as for now, just clone, cd in, flutter run and voil√† 

Thanks to TheNightmanCodeth for his DitRA work, i've taken some inspirations for the some parts in the code where i've got stuck
